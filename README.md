# Spark for Machine Learning [Video]
This is the code repository for [Spark for Machine Learning [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/spark-machine-learning-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786466594), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Spark lets you apply machine learning techniques to data in real time, giving users immediate machine-learning based insights based on what's happening right now. Using Spark, we can create machine learning models and programs that are distributed and much faster compared to standard machine learning toolkits such as R or Python.

In this course, you’ll learn how to use the Spark MLlib. You’ll find out about the supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. You’ll build classifications models, extracting proper futures from text using Word2Vect to achieve this. Next, we’ll build a Logistic Regression Model with Spark. Then we’ll find clusters and correlations in our data using K-Means clustering. We’ll learn how to validate models using cross-validation and area under the ROC measurement.

You’ll also build an effective Recommendation Model using distributed Spark algorithm. We will look at graph processing with GraphX library. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to focus on leveraging Spark to create fast and efficient machine learning programs.
